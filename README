Sprite version 0.01
===================

Sprite.pm is a pure-perl module that uses Gnome Canvas to implement C64 style sprites.  A number of convenient methods are provided to help move the sprites around and tell if they have collided.  This functionality should probably go into C at some point.

This module requires that Gtk.pm and Gnome.pm be installed in order to run, however you may install it without these (it just won't do any good :).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Gtk.pm (and Gtk)
Gnome.pm (and Gnome)
